# Inverton_analysis

This repository contains a Snakemake workflow for running **PhaseFinder** on multiple genomes and paired-end sequencing reads. The workflow automates the detection of inverted DNA regions, generation of inverted sequences, and quantification of read ratios.  

> **Note:** This workflow uses **UHGG genomes** (Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome collection) as reference genomes.
